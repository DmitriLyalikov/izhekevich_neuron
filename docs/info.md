## How it works
This is a simple Izhikevich model of a neuron. The Izhikevich model is a spiking neuron that is able to replicate the behavior of many different types of neurons. The model is described by the following equations:
    v' = 0.04v^2 + 5v + 140 - u + I
    u' = a(bv - u)
    if v >= 30 then v = c, u = u + d

The model has four parameters: a, b, c, and d. These parameters can be adjusted to replicate the behavior of different types of neurons. The model also has an input current I that can be used to stimulate the neuron. The model is implemented in the `izhikevich_neuron` module. The module has a `step` method that takes an input current and updates the state of the neuron. The module also has a `get_voltage` method that returns the current voltage of the neuron.
